Where is Sam?

Our teaching assistant Sam has disappeared! All the teaching assistants, as well as Professor Bloomfield, were at a department sponsored TA retreat. There were some issues getting home, but everybody eventually did. However, nobody can find Sam. Where could he be?

As part of the investigation, the authorities have confiscated a computer of the "fifth" teaching assistant (the one who does all the grading but doesn't hold office hours). While they are working on it, they thought you could help, and have provided you with a image of the hard drive for you to analyze.

But you have no idea what to look for...

(Note: in the real world, you might get into legal trouble for doing this type of search, since the owner of the computer did not give you permission, and you don't have a search warrant. But this is an assignment, and FAKE, so there is no legal trouble to get into for this assignment.)

(And yes, Sam is just fine in the real world.)
Assignment

Find out what's "up".

Spoiler: there is obviously a story that this disk image can tell, otherwise there wouldn't be this assignment.

The intent is for you to use Autopsy / SleuthKit for this assignment, as well as some command-line tools. You will also want to be familiar with the digital forensics slide set.
Details

You can get a copy of the hard drive image by going to https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/forensics/ -- you will have to use Netbadge to log in. You can not use somebody else's disk image! You have to wait until you are told the images are ready for this semester. The image was compressed with gzip -- if your operating system does not natively support it, then you can use 7-zip to extract it. The compressed .gz file is 4 Gb in size, and the uncompressed image is 10 Gb in size.

This image was designed using Linux (it's an ext4 file system). However, you can do this homework on any host OS. The course VirtualBox image is configured to run Autopsy. Within that image, you can download your disk image, un-gzip it, and run autopsy right from the command line.
Tools allowed

The intent of this assignment is for you to use Autopsy / SleuthKit. In addition to Autopsy and SleuthKit, you can use the standard tools that come with an operating system -- in particular, file explorers, searching contents of files for text, etc. You can use any of the utilities discussed in the digital forensics slide set. You can use differently named equivalents in differing operating systems.

You may NOT use any OTHER existing digital forensic tools for this assignment, beyond the what is mentioned in the previous paragraph. You are to use your knowledge of forensics, the forensics slide set, and the existing OS commands. In particular, the "Techniques" section of that slide set has the necessary techniques to find what can be found on this disk image. We recommend learning a few commands: strings, find, and grep may be particularly useful for Linux. You can Google for equivalents in other OSes. Note that some of the information on the disk image was specifically designed to NOT be able to be (easily) found with Autopsy / SleuthKit.

If you are NOT using the course VirtualBox image, you can install Autopsy by viewing the details at Autopsy's website. It's already installed on the VirtualBox image. The current version is 4.10 -- make sure you are using that version (or a more recent one if available).
Running on the VirtualBox image

To run Autopsy on the VirtualBox image, just run autopsy.

Note that Autopsy will report a number of "Zip bombs". We did not place any of those on the hard drive image, so you can ignore all those warnings.
Deliverable

The deliverable is a PDF report, named mst3k.pdf (change 'mst3k' to your userid).

The report will be divided into a number of parts. So that we can easily figure out what you found out, please make it clear which part of your report are for which part.

Part 1 is the primary questions of answer:

    Where is Sam? (and any other related info, such as why is he gone, who knows about it, etc.)
    What parts of the story can you put together?

This part of this report should contain as much of the story as you can determine. Note that you will be able to get partial credit based on what you find, even if you don't find everything.

The second part of this report should contain the information that you found, and how you found it. The how-you-found-it is is important, as there are a multiple ways to find each piece of information. Please be brief, but concise -- we have to read through all of these, and we don't want to read through pages and pages of content when it can be summarized in a much shorter amount.

The third part is to comment on this assignment:

    What did you think of it? We are looking for an honest answer here, not a sycophantic one.
    Was there anything that we screwed up on? Specifically, was there a particular piece of evidence in which we did not properly hide something? Or did we give something away?
    Give one (or more!) suggestions for additional content to hide, or where to hide it, or improvements to the story.

The PDF report is the only item to submit.
