# CS3501 - Introduction to Cybersecurity (ICS)

This is a course is an introduction to cyber security. It starts with ethics of the security business and it briefly touches on different aspects of cyber security. It was an uneven course in terms of the difficulty of the assignments. The RSA implementation in Java and the buffer overflow attack in C almost took me forever to do while the writing assignments were very superficial. There was one forensic assignment that in which we were given an image of a hard drive, and we had to use a forensic tool (SleuthKit of Autopsy) to figure out the underlying story behind it and what happened to the owner of the computer. It was the most interesting assignment of this course from my view.
